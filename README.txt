This plugin allows you very simply syntax highlight source code in your content using highlight.js or google-code-prettify libraries.

== Description ==

The CC-Syntax-Highlight plugin supports syntax highlighting of Posts, Pages, and any public Custom Post Types.
It uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [google-code-prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) libraries.
Additionally it can use the [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) library to add a button that copies text to the clipboard and [highlightjs-line-numbers.js](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/) plugin to add line numbers.
It is delivered with support for shortcode (default [code] - you can change it on the settings page) which automatically converts all special characters to HTML entities.
This plugin is compatible with Multisite WordPress installations.

= How does it work? =

1. Go to the 'Settings > Syntax Highlight' page, select your preferred options and save them.
2. Simply add the source code to your post (or other selected public Custom Post Type) wrapped with:
`&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Your source code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;`
or if you would like to automatically convert all special characters to HTML entities, use shortcode wrapper instead (default [code] - you can change it on the settings page):
`&lt;pre&gt;[code]Your source code[/code]&lt;/pre&gt;`

_Plugin's js scripts and css styles files only load if the source code occurs on displaying page._
